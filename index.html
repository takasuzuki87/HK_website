        <p>Hiroko Kumaki is a sociocultural anthropologist whose research and teaching lies at the intersections of health, environment, and technoscience. Her scholarship examines the affective, material, and conceptual world making around environmental change, particularly as it relates to the experience of health and well-being. Her first book project, “Reasonably Exposed,” asks what it means to live well in a world that embraces certain levels of environmental exposure as “reasonable,” to be accepted by the general public for the broader good that toxigenic practices enable. Focusing on the ongoing aftermath of the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan, the project studies how knowledge and practices on environment and health interact and operate across multiple bodies, scales, and registers, to shape divergent political and ethical responses to the radioactive fallout. Hiroko is committed to ethnographic methods that engage and write “from” the lives of interlocutors, rather than “for” or “about” them. While at Dartmouth, she will begin her second project that investigates the relationship between technological innovation and environmental remediation in the U.S. and Japan.
